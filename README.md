The Medical Application is designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart diseases using machine learning and data analysis. This project leverages predictive analytics to assess the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient health metrics.

By combining data visualization, statistical modeling, and an intuitive interface, the application aims to improve early diagnosis and decision-making in clinical settings.

🚀 Features
✔ Heart Disease Prediction – Uses a trained machine learning model to assess patient risk.
✔ Data Visualization – Provides clear insights into patient health metrics through interactive charts.
✔ User-Friendly Interface – Designed for easy interaction with healthcare professionals in mind.
✔ Efficient & Scalable – Built using Java, Gradle, and Jupyter Notebooks for flexibility and scalability.
